# Submission Notes for Angular Product List View Assessment

## Introduction

This document details the completed Angular assessment for the product list view, assigned during the interview. The task involved creating a product list view using Angular, adhering to SOLID principles and best e-commerce practices.

## Technologies Used

Angular framework (for building the application)
Bootstrap (for responsive design and layout components)

## Folder Structure

The project utilizes a standard Angular folder structure for enhanced scalability and maintainability. Key directories include components, services, interfaces and assets.

## Component Architecture

The product component has a scope for following SOLID principles, with each child component will be responsible for a single aspect. Encapsulation and reusability can be emphasized to maintain clean and modular code.

## Functionality Implemented

The product list view displays essential information preloaded. Due to the absence of backend APIs, the implementation focuses on frontend functionality.

## Recommendations for Enhancement (if backend APIs were available)

Virtual Scrolling: Improves performance for large datasets.
Optimized HTTP Requests Handling with RxJS: Enables efficient data fetching and manipulation.

## Key Points to Note

The code adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
Bootstrap provides layout components, but custom CSS can be implemented for specific design requirements.
